## Origins++ Modded Support Datapack Template
This repository is a template for a datapack that can be used with Origins++ to add support for additional items not included in the base mod. Download it and add items to the appropriate tag for compatibility with other mods in your modpack or playthrough.
***
To add support for a mod in Origins++ itself, either:
- Submit a [pull request](https://github.com/QuantumXenon/origins-plus-plus-modded-support/pulls) adding items from a mod into the relevant tags (faster response time)
- Submit a mod compatability request using the '[Issues](https://github.com/QuantumXenon/origins-plus-plus-modded-support/issues)' tab and specify which tag(s) you would like items added to (slower response time)
